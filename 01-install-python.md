# Installing Python
If you want to code in Python, you will need to install Python.

We are talking Python3. None of that Python2 or less rubbish. Always use Python3. Python has gone through a few evolutions and it is one of
its downsides. When you google how to do stuff in Python - first check you are getting a Python3 answer!

## What Python have you got already?

```bash
$ python --version
```
You will want to see something like...
```
Python 3.11.6
```

if it says `3.x` then move onto the next page. If NOT then use the instructions below to install Python3. 

## MacOS

Install python3:
```bash
$ brew install python
```
