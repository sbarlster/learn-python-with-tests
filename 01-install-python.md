# Installing Python
If you want to code in Python, you will need to install Python.

We are talking Python3. None of that Python2 or less rubbish. Always use Python3. Python has gone through a few evolutions and it is one of
its downsides. When you google how to do stuff in Python - first check you are getting a Python3 answer!

## What Python have you got?

```bash
python --version
```

You will want to see something like...
```
Python 3.11.6
```

if it says `3.x` then move onto the next page (you already have Python3 installed). If NOT then use the instructions below to install Python3. 

## MacOS

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is __the__ way to install stuff on MacOS.

Install python3:
```bash
brew install python
```

again run `python --version` and you should see something like `Python 3.11.6`

If you run `which python` you should see that Python has been installed into `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`

Job done, you can now go to the next page! üëç
