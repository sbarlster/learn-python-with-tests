# learn-python-with-tests
Learn to code Python through the medium of unit testing


## Why Python?
1. Everyone learns coding with Python (well nearly everyone)
2. You can build webapps with two of the best frameworks (Express or Django)
3. You can build backends (APIs and services) with again two amazing frameworks (Flask or FastAPI)
4. You can process data with the best data framework (Pandas)
5. And finally because of its natural use in data processing you can build AI systems with HuggingFace or the OpenAI system


## Why Tests?
Because the bedrock of great software are unit tests.

* Unit tests tell you if your software is doing what you want it to do
* Unit tests are easy to build
* Unit tests are fast to run
* Unit tests are focused - because they are running small units of code - you know where to look for a problem

Unit tests will allow us to learn in small steps and the test will explain what we are doing.

Python comes with a great unit testing library called pytest.

First lets install Python and run our first and simplest program.
